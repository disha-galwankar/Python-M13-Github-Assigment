Monthly Spending Tracker

Description: This spending tracker essentially takes an input of someone's monthly spending and calculates, based on that input, how much they are on track to spend in the next year. The problem this program addresses is tracking spending in order to budget accurately. By forecasting yearly spending, a person can then allocate their budgets and yearly income each month in order to fit their current spending habits.
